# Mujina
A cross-platform injectable cheat base for minecraft made in java, loaded with c++ 

This is more like a proof concept right now, its main purpose is to show that you can make injectable cheats with java.

There is a lot of useless / over-complicated code because it wasn't supposed to be public at first, and its part of a future bigger project.

## Mythology
Mujina takes inspiration from the Japanese Mythology, and incorporates it in to its symbolism. Mujina (also known as the Noppera-Bo), are faceless y√µkai who seem like normal people from far away, but on closer inspection are faceless beings, who deeply unsettle and scare those who see them. Such is the user of the client - blends in and is faceless. 

 
## Developers
The Developers of the client are as follows:

LeFraudeur - Base, injection, and sdk, data transfer

Lagoon - Bypasses and CLI (and internal GUI and settings, apparently)

kek - sdk and data transfer/api between gui and client

rk3 - webview, external GUI, and website in general

CrystalEU aka Nullable - Bypasses and CLI
